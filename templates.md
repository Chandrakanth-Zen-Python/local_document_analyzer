Cold LinkedIn message (short):

Hi <name>, I’m a Lead Data Engineer who builds AI automations and production LLM apps. I help teams save time by automating repetitive workflows (reports, ticket triage, document QA). Could I share a 10-min idea that might save your team a few hours/week?

Warm outreach (ex-colleague):

Hey <name>, hope you’re well — quick one: I’m helping companies automate manual reporting and build small RAG copilots. Do you know anyone who might benefit from a 1-week PoC? I can demo something in 15min.

Freelance reply template (proposal intro):

Thanks for the invite — I can deliver an MVP automation (PoC) in 2 weeks. It will include data ingestion, a simple UI, and a demo. Budget range I usually work with: ₹15k–₹60k depending on scope. Happy to share a short proposal.
